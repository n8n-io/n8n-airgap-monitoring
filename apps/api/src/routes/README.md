# Routes Folder

Routes define the pathways within your application.
Fastify's structure supports the modular monolith approach, where your
application is organized into distinct, self-contained modules.
This facilitates easier scaling and future transition to a microservice architecture.
In the future you might want
to independently deploy some of those.

In this folder you should define all the routes that define the endpoints
of your web application.
Each service is a [Fastify
plugin](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Reference/Plugins/), it is
encapsulated (it can have its own independent plugins) and it is
typically stored in a file; be careful to group your routes logically,
e.g. all `/users` routes in a `users.js` file. We have added
a `root.js` file for you with a '/' root added.

Routes are not discovered from this directory, and a route's URL is not derived
from the folder it lives in. Register the route in `src/app.ts` and give it its
prefix there.

If a single file becomes too large, create a folder and add an `index.ts` file
there: that file must be a Fastify plugin. You can now add as many files as you
want inside that folder. In this way you can create complex routes within a
single monolith, and eventually extract them.

If you need to share functionality between routes, place that
functionality into the `plugins` folder, and share it via
[decorators](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Reference/Decorators/).

If you're a bit confused about using `async/await` to write routes, you would
better take a look at [Promise resolution](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Reference/Routes/#promise-resolution) for more details.
